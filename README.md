# Fullstack NFT Marketplace on Ethereum with Polygon, Nextjs, Wagmi and RainbowKit

This project is to demonstrate how to build a Fullstack application using Polygon and Nextjs with Wagmi and Rainbowkit as Wallet Connection Manager. It would also demonstrate how to style the frontend using Chakra-UI. You could actually make use of any styling library of your choice but I have recently come to like building with Chakra but TailwindCSS is also a great library you could use. The choice of Polygon is to benefit from the lower gas transactions available on the Polygon blockchain. Polygon is one of the scaling solutions of Ethereum. Others include [Arbitrum](https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/developer_quickstart), and [Optimism](https://optimism.io/).

## Inspiration

The NFT marketplace is a demonstration of the how to build a marketplace similar to OpenSea using Polygon, Next.js with decentralized storage on IPFS.
